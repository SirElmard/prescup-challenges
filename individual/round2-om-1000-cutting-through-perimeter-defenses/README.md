# Cutting through perimeter defenses
#### Category: Operate and Maintain
#### Difficulty Level: 1000
#### Executive Order Category: Network Operations

## Background
Encryption often limits the visibility of cyber defenders. We suspect that sensitive traffic left our network, but we can’t confirm that since we don’t do SSL/TLS inspection. Can you decrypt this network traffic to find the flag?

## Getting Started

### Traffic Analysis

You are provided with a packet capture and a memory dump from a machine suspected to be involved in the incident. Analyze the traffic capture using any tools that you feel are appropriate to find the flag. You will find the flag within the PCAP in the format of the string “Your flag is: {11 characters}”. `The 11 characters contained between the "{" and "}" is your answer`.
