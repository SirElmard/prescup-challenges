# Bumbling Binary Bits
#### Category: Securely Provision
#### Difficulty Level: 1000
#### Executive Order Category: Obfuscated Coding

## Background

The given variant of the challenge is one of four possible. The comment at the top of the file gives command line
inputs.

## Getting Started

Given the C program and the command line inputs, find the output of this program.

## Correction

This challenge was originally meant to be solved by manually following the execution on pen and paper, but that
instruction didn't make it to the final lab guide. The VM given during the competition restricted copy/paste
functionality, but of course there was no way to stop someone from copying the code line-by-line.
